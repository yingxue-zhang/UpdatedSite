I am an Assistant Professor in Computer Science Department at Binghamton University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree in Data Science from Worcester Polytechnic Institute. Broad research interests include: (1) designing novel data mining, machine learning and AI techniques to solve spatial-temporal big data analytics problems related to smart cities, public safety, sustainability and business, and (2) human behavior analysis in autonomous driving, financial market and decision making using meta-learning, reinforcement learning and imitation learning methods.

**Openings:**Â I am looking for self-motivated PhD students to work with me on the exciting area of deep learning. I'm particularly interested in candidates with background in Artificial Intelligence, Deep Learning, Data Mining, Machine Learning, Statistics, Applied Math, and strong programming skill. Please send me a short email with your C.V. and anything you believe relevant!
